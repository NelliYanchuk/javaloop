# Console Application: Multiplication Table

Create a console application that, given an integer \( n \), prints its multiplication table (from 1 to 10). Each multiple \( n \times i \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq 10 \)) should be printed on a new line in the format: `n x i = result` (multiplication table).

### Example:
Given \( n = 5 \)

**Output:**
5 x 1 = 5 
5 x 2 = 10 
5 x 3 = 15 
5 x 4 = 20 
5 x 5 = 25 
5 x 6 = 30 
5 x 7 = 35 
5 x 8 = 40 
5 x 9 = 45 
5 x 10 = 50

### Requirements:
- Unit tests with a minimum of 70% coverage

### Deliverables:
- GitHub repository (link)
- Activity diagram
- Screenshot of the "Testing" section in Visual Studio Code showing test coverage

### What is an Activity Diagram?
Activity diagrams, along with use case diagrams and state machine diagrams, are considered behavior diagrams because they describe what should happen in the system being modeled.
